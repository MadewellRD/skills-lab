# Data Command Desk v1.1.0

Status: published
Date: 2026-07-25

## Summary

Data Command Desk rebuilt on the `frontier-2026-07` capability profile. Every skill in this
suite is generated from a single source cascade and carries the same capability
baseline, so the assumptions it makes about the executing model are explicit and
versioned rather than implied.

This release is vendor-neutral by construction. The packaged artifacts here name no
model vendor; per-vendor builds are generated from the same source under
`dist/vendor/<vendor>/`.

## What changed

- Scaffolding written for weaker models replaced with outcome, constraints, and an
  acceptance bar. Ordering kept only where it is externally mandated and getting it
  wrong is unsafe.
- Halt conditions retargeted from uncertainty to six consequence classes. Absent
  evidence is a soft gap; unreachable evidence is a hard halt.
- Token conservation replaced by handoff density. At current context sizes the
  constraint is ambiguity, not volume.
- Stages operating over independent items declare a parallel surface.
- Output contracts state the artifact set a complete run delivers rather than a menu.
  This never licenses inventing an artifact that has no source basis.

## Governance

Governance invariants were held fixed: never invent facts, separate fact from
assumption, preserve source hierarchy and conflicts, respect approval and
destructive-action gates. A more capable model is a reason to remove scaffolding,
never a reason to remove governance.

## Breaking changes

Compatibility shims are RETIRED as of v1.1.0. The pre-v1.0.0 names no longer
ship, so anything still reading them must move to the current names.

## Artifacts

- Packaged skills: `dist/packages/data-command-desk/`
- Checksums: `dist/manifests/data-command-desk-CHECKSUMS.txt`
- JSON manifest: `dist/manifests/data-command-desk-v1.1.0.json`
- Root checksums: `CHECKSUMS.txt`

## Verify

```bash
python3 tools/audit_skills.py
python3 tools/validate_release_assets.py
```

Archives are deterministic: the same source produces byte-identical zips, so a
checksum mismatch means the content actually changed.
